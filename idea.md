I am writing a paper about how using Effect (effect-ts) in TypeScript projects improves productivity, code safety, code style, maintenance, scalability, etc., and that this holds true regardless of complexity level, but that there's a strong correlation between increasing complexity and the magnitude of these benefits.

The @guidelines.md file has some guidelines on what and how to do to write this paper.

DEFINITELY make sure that you search all available documentation you can reach through your tools to get the latest up-to-date info about how to use effect-ts.


Please write a scsientific paper for me and make sure it is complete, aligns with best practices, correctly formatted.

If needed, add references and citations with pure high standard, and if necessary, add example applications.
